"""Three composability detectors miss the thing when a file states it structurally.

Each of these has one demonstrated false negative in schliff's own SKILL.md — a line
that earns the point and does not get it because the regex demands a specific English
phrasing instead of the fact itself.

`_RE_IDEMPOTENCY` and `_RE_NAMESPACE_ISOLATION` are deliberately NOT touched: measured
across benchmarks/corpus/v1 they hit 1/21 and 4/21, and neither has a demonstrated
false negative. No measurement accuses them.
